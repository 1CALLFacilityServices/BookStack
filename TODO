### Next

- Table cell height resize & cell width resize via width style
  - Column resize source: https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-tables/blob/master/src/columnresizing.js
  - Have updated column resizing to set cell widths
    - Now need to handle table overall size on change, then heights. 

- Details/Summary
  - Need view to control summary editability, make readonly but editable via popover.
  - Need some default styles to visualise details boundary.
  - Markdown parser needs to be updated to handle separate open/close tags for blocks. 

### In-Progress

- Tables
- Details/Summary

### Features

- Images
- Drawings
- LTR/RTL control
- Fullscreen
- Paste Image Uploading
- Drag + Drop Image Uploading
- Checkbox/TODO list items
- Code blocks
- Indents
- Attachment integration (Drag & drop)
- Template system integration.

### Improvements

- List type changing.
- Color picker options should have "clear" option.
- Color picker buttons should be split, with button to re-apply last selected color.
- Color picker options should change color if different instead of remove.
- Clear formatting, If no selection range, clear the formatting of parent block.
  - If no marks, clear the block type if text type?
- Remove links button? (Action already in place if link href is empty).
- Links - Validate URL.
- Links - Integrate entity picker.
- iFrame - Parse iframe HTML & auto-convert youtube/vimeo urls to embeds. 

### Notes

- Use NodeViews for embedded content (Code, Drawings) where control is needed.
- Probably still easiest to have seperate (codemirror) MD editor. Can alter display output via NodeViews to make MD like
  but its tricky since editing the markdown content would change the block definition/type while editing.
