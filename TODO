### Improvements

- List type changing.
- Color picker options should have "clear" option.
- Color picker buttons should be split, with button to re-apply last selected color.
- Color picker options should change color if different instead of remove.
- Clear formatting, If no selection range, clear the formatting of parent block.
  - If no marks, clear the block type if text type?
- Remove links button? (Action already in place if link href is empty).
- Links - Limit target attribute options and validate URL.
- Links - Integrate entity picker.

### Notes

- Use NodeViews for embedded content (Code, Drawings) where control is needed.
- Probably still easiest to have seperate (codemirror) MD editor. Can alter display output via NodeViews to make MD like
  but its tricky since editing the markdown content would change the block definition/type while editing.
